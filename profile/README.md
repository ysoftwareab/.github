# We ask "why?"

because software is just a means to an end to us,<br>
not a goal in itself.

We are a product-led software consulting company<br>
with a strong background in bootstrapping greenfield products and development environments,<br>
often in the public cloud but not limited to it.

We believe tech products and services should focus on the customer and market value, not on the tech stack.<br>
We use time-tested and simple best practices so that your team can have a stronger and more agile product management.
